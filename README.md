# 🚪 Interactive Doors

## 📖 Description
**Interactive Doors** is a simple, interactive game where you make different choices by clicking on colorful doors. Each door leads you to a new room, and your goal is to reach the final room.  
To unlock the last door, you must collect **two special objects** hidden in different rooms.

This was my **first project using JavaScript**, created to explore and experiment with basic interactivity, event handling, and DOM manipulation.
